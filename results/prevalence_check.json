      "explanation": "The inverted severe:moderate ratio suggests either (1) selection bias toward more severe cases in the exam-eligible population, (2) cumulative effect of hierarchical classification (severe checked first), or (3) potential CDC/AAP implementation differences. This warrants further investigation."

    "impact_on_study": "Our binary outcome (any periodontitis vs. none) does not depend on the mild/moderate/severe split. The prediction task remains valid for screening purposes. The high prevalence (68%) means the model operates in a class-balanced setting, which may improve recall estimates but limit applicability to lower-prevalence populations.",
    "recommendation": "Future work should investigate the CDC/AAP labeling implementation and compare tooth-level classifications with published NHANES documentation."
